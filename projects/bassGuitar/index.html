            <h1>Bass Guitar Build Log</h1>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p>
            Since I still have a lot of <span class="walnut">black walnut</span> and <span class="padauk">padauk</span> left
            over from my previous guitar build, I decided to build a bass guitar as side project during my 4th semester. 
        </p>
        <section class="table">
        <p>
            On the right, you can see some basic specifications of the bass that I've decided on at the beginning of the project.
            These specs were chosen at the beginning to give me a general idea of the design and layout of the build.
        </p>
        <div class="labelledTable">
        <table name="table1">
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Value</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scale Length</td>
                <td>34"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pickup Layout</td>
                <td>PJ</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Neck Style</td>
                <td>Neck Through</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Neck Wood</td>
                <td>Padauk</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Body Wood</td>
                <td>Black Walnut and Padauk</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <label for="table1"><b>Table 1</b>: Basic Specifications</label>
        </div>
        </section>
        <p>
            You'll notice that at this stage, the only dimension I've picked out is the scale length of the build.
            That is because I don't want to restrict the design process too much yet, so only choosing a scale length early allows me to explore design options.
